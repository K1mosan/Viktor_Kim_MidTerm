    <h1>Why we love cats</h1><br>
    <p>In my whole life, I have always had cats in my family. We love these fluffy, lovable creatures very much. I made a little list of why we all love them. First of all, for their purring. If a cat purrs next to you, it means your love is mutual. Especially purring soothes and relaxes you when you are sad or stressed. Cats have soft paws that they like to play with everything in the house. They are very nice to the touch and are pleasant to tickle. Create a homey and cozy atmosphere in the house. Cats are very affectionate and funny animals. Sometimes with their ridiculousness they can really amuse you and your family.</p>
