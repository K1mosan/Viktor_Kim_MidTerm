    <h2>Why Dogs is better than cats?</h2>
    <p>Dogs are more social and interactive. 
            Dogs crave human interaction and enjoy playing fetch or going on walks. Dogs are also known to be loyal and protective of their family and home. Cats, on the other hand, are more independent and often prefer to be left alone. Cats typically do not enjoy playing fetch or going for walks and are not as loyal or protective of their family and home.

    <h2>Fun Fact:</h2>
    <p>Dogs are able to understand up to 250 words and gestures, while cats can understand only about 25.</p>

    <h1>Why we love cats</h1><br>
    <p>In my whole life, I have always had cats in my family. We love these fluffy, lovable creatures very much. I made a little list of why we all love them. First of all, for their purring. If a cat purrs next to you, it means your love is mutual. Especially purring soothes and relaxes you when you are sad or stressed. Cats have soft paws that they like to play with everything in the house. They are very nice to the touch and are pleasant to tickle. Create a homey and cozy atmosphere in the house. Cats are very affectionate and funny animals. Sometimes with their ridiculousness they can really amuse you and your family.</p>
